/// A simple mock representation of a data frame used in link-layer simulations.

/// This struct is intended for educational and simulation purposes only. It does not
/// conform to any real-world data link protocol (such as Ethernet, HDLC, PPP, etc.)
/// and is free of protocol-specific headers, control bits, or error-checking schemes.

/// The frame contains only a basic `id` and `data` field. It includes a mock
/// checksum calculation based on a simple XOR operation and provides methods
/// to decode the payload as a UTF-8 string.
///
/// This is a **protocol-agnostic**, minimalistic abstraction, useful for
/// building and testing higher-level ideas like ARQ protocols, simulation
/// of corruption, or logical frame handling without worrying about physical-level details.
